### Rule

- Replies must use the ZH-TW format.

- When modifying the constitution.md file, you must force it to be translated into Traditional Chinese and synchronized with the .specify/memory/constitution_zh-tw.md file to ensure high consistency between the two files. If there are differences between the two files, you must use constitution_zh-tw.md as the standard, translate this file into English, and then write it back to constitution.md.

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly recommended for all program development.
